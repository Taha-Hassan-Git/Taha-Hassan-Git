## Software Development Bootcamp
I've graduated from a highly selective front-end web-development bootcamp with [Founders and Coders](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/).

- [ ] Get hired as an apprentice
- [ ] Make amazing software!


## I'm working on...
[HearHere](https://github.com/Hear-Here-Game/Hear-Here), an audio based geography guessing game. It's a react web app written in Typescript that uses Aws lambda functions to make API calls.

Dungeon Master Mind, an AI powered toolkit for game masters to help them generate content for their games.

Expanding my [2D collision code](https://github.com/Taha-Hassan-Git/2D-Particle-Collision-Simulator) into a physics game called Crazy Snooker.
